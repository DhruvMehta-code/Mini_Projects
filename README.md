# HacktoberFest-2020 ‚ùÑ

#### Edit 1: Don't add something if its already there in the same programming language. Try to add quality content. I won't merge PRs if you are spamming with PRs.

#### Edit 2: You contribution would be counted towards Hacktoberfest if it has been approved or merged or has a "hacktoberfest-accepted" label. It is not mandatory to have all 3 on a particular PR.

Open source is changing the world - one pull request at a time.

## Why Should I Contribute?

The Hacktoberfest‚Äôs simple plain objective is:
Support open source and earn a limited edition T-shirt!

## What if my pull requests aren‚Äôt accepted?

Even if your pull requests aren‚Äôt accepted, they should still count toward your 4 pull requests necessary to earn the shirt. The only exception would be if the project maintainer chooses to mark your pull request as ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù. They may do this if they perceive your pull request to be low effort, or if it contains plagiarism.

## What kinds of pull requests count toward earning the Hacktoberfest shirt?
Any pull request made to a public repo on GitHub will count. The pull request must contain commits you personally made yourself ‚Äî not automated commits from bots.
